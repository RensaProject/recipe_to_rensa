# Recipe to Rensa

## Overview
Extract ingredients from a recipe written in English. Store as Rensa encodings (Simprel format).  

Example: "1 pound carrots, purple" is stored as a Rensa assertion that separates the ingredient name ("carrots"), numerical amount ("1"), unit ("pound"), and additional comments ("purple".)

(Recipe instructions can also be parsed and the Simprel JSON structures can be realized - just ask if you're interested!)

## Requirements
This code requires [rensabrain](https://github.com/RensaProject/rensabrain) and ingredient parser.  The latter can be installed with pip:
```
pip install ingredient_parser
```
