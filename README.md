# Recipe to Rensa

## Overview
Extract ingredients from a recipe written in English. Store as Rensa encodings (Simprel format).  

(Recipe instructions can also be parsed and the Simprel JSON structures can be realized - just ask if you're interested!)

## Requirements
This code requires [rensabrain](https://github.com/RensaProject/rensabrain) and ingredient parser.  The latter can be installed with pip:
```
pip install ingredient_parser
```
