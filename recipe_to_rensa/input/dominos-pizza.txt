5 cups all-purpose flour or 5 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon instant yeast
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 3⁄4 cups warm water

In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients, stirring vigorously.
Set aside to rest five minutes, and then stir again for three to five minutes.
Add additional water or flour to achieve a smooth, sticky dough.
Divide into four pieces and place each one into an oiled freezer bag.
At this point, dough can be refrigerated or frozen.
Allow to rise at room temperature and then punch down.
Stretch each piece onto a ten inch pizza pan and allow to rest a few minutes.
Top as usual, and then bake at 450°F until crust is crisp and cheese has melted.
(Makes 4 ten inch pizzas.).
